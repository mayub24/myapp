                        <p>As soon as I graduated from high school, I dove right into learning different programming
                            languages and had developed a
                            strong passion for Software Development. Over the course of my first two years at Seneca, I
                            have
                            gained a wide variety of
                            skills such as JavaScript (Angular/React), HTML5, CSS3 (Bulma/Bootstrap 4), C, C++ and have
                            attained an excitement for working
                            with the Linux command line.</p>
